# Power Electronics Engineer

Specialized in advanced control systems and power conversion.

## Technical Expertise
* **Control Theory:** Loop gain analysis and active damping for LCL filters.
* **Simulation:** Expert-level use of **Typhoon HIL** for real-time testing.
* **Hardware:** Powering systems with **Chroma 62180D** bidirectional supplies.

## Current Projects
I am currently analyzing inverter stability using MATLAB. For example, calculating the transfer function:

$$G(s) = \frac{V_{out}(s)}{V_{in}(s)}$$
