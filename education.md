## Selected Graduate Coursework
To support my research in power conversion and grid integration, I have completed advanced training in the following areas:

### Power Electronics & Systems
* **Switched Mode Power Conversion:** Covered dc-dc converter modeling and control from the book *Fundamentals of Power Electronics-Erikson,Maksimovic*. Taught by *Dr. G Narayanan, Dr. Vinod John* at IISc.
* **Topics in Power Electronics and Distributed Generation:** Design, modeling, and control of grid-integrated Distributed Generation (DG) systems, emphasizing fault analysis, converter hardware optimization (thermal, reliability, cost, and component selection), and advanced control strategies for grid synchronization and power quality compliance. Taught by * Dr. Vinod John* at IISc.
* **Electric Drives:** Field oriented control of AC motor, space vectors covering this [book](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~amitjain/Drives_VTR.pdf). Taught by *Dr. G Narayanan* at IISc.
* **Advanced Topics in Power Electronics:** Covered advanced bus clamping techniques (Dr. Lipo's book on PWM) and matrix converter. Taught by *Dr. Kaushik Basu* at IISc.

### Control Theory
* **Linear Algebra:** Covered topics ranging from linear algebra, SVD, eigenvalue, least-sqaure and least-norm solutions to under-determined and over-detemined systems, state space formulation. Taught by *Dr. Maryam Fazel* at UW.
* **Convex Optimization:** Covered I-*Theory* and II-*Application* from [Boyd and Vandenberghe](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/)  Taught by *Dr. Maryam Fazel* at UW.
* **Digital Control** Covered digital control, modeling systems and direct digital control using root-locus and nyquist from [book](https://archive.org/details/digitalcontrolen0000fada) For the lab, assignments were done using [myRIO](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/engineering-education/portable-student-devices/myrio-student-embedded-device/what-is-myrio.html)  Taught by *Dr. Sawyer Fuller* at UW.
* **Classical Control** Covered the fundamentals of closed loop control, Bode's laws, root-locus, nyquist, describing functions. Taught by *Dr. G.R. Jayanth* at IISc.
* **Robust Control** Covered the theoretical aspects of robust control. Taught by *Dr. Sam Burden* at UW. My course project was this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09022) 
* **Nonlinear Control** Covered topics related to limit cycling, Lypaunov theorem, singular perturbation theory from Nonlinear Control by Khalil. Taught by *Dr. Santosh Devasia* at UW.
